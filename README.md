# ComputerGraphics
  
This is a simple project for ray-tracing with some additional techniques:  
  
1. Anti-aliasing  
Using average sampling, I cast 50 rays for the same pixel with different offset range from 
0 ~ 1.  

2. Procedural texture  
Perlin Noise with chessboard and stripe texture.

3. Objects  
I use vector constraints to create cylinder and box objects.
